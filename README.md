# startup-example
An example start up project

Change from my developement environment!


Change from Github creating merge conflict?!?!

another change from github because it didn't work first time


I learned a lot about Github from this assignment, I have used it before but since I was working on projects myself I never had to worry about merge conflicts. It took me a fat minute to figure out how to create one but now that I learned it, I think this will be very useful as I have never worked on stuff with other people!

Setting up Github for CS 260

STARTUP:
HOW FOCUSED ARE YOU? My website will be a reacreation of the arcade game where there is a wheel with a needle and a box, when you begin the needle rotates and when it hovers over the box, you push spacebar to gain a point, a new box will appear and the direction of the needle will flip from clockwise to counterclockwise and will continuously get faster as you gain a higher score. Failure occurs when you press spacebar to early or needle goes past the box. Do you have what it takes to get the highscore?


FEATURES: 
Ability to login and create an account that will track all of your previous scores as well as your personal highscore
Display of the overall best highscore from any player
Colors will change every 10 points to indicate "higher level" while needle also moves faster
Unique celebratory message when you beat your personal high score or the overall high score

Default difficulty where needle gets faster every 10 points
Hard difficulty where needle starts out incredibly fast
