Change from Github creating merge conflict?!?!

another change from github because it didn't work first time


I learned a lot about Github from this assignment, I have used it before but since I was working on projects myself I never had to worry about merge conflicts. It took me a fat minute to figure out how to create one but now that I learned it, I think this will be very useful as I have never worked on stuff with other people!
